            <p>
              At <strong>Uma Memorial Public School</strong>, our vision has always been to create an institution where 
              <em>education goes beyond books and classrooms</em>. Since our foundation in 2006 under 
              <strong>Late Baliraj Singh Education Welfare and Society</strong>, we have strived to nurture 
              students who are not only academically accomplished but also responsible, compassionate, 
              and forward-thinking citizens.
            </p>
            <p>
              Education is the most powerful tool to bring transformation, and at UMPS, we aim to provide 
              every child with the knowledge, values, and confidence to face the future with courage and integrity.
              Together with our committed teachers and supportive parents, we continue to work towards shaping 
              a generation that will make a difference in society.
            </p>
